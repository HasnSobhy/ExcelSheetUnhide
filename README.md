# ExcelSheetUnhide

Latest version is 1.0.0

This Powershell script is used to Reveal / Unhide hidden Excel Spread Sheets and Workbooks.
This is especially relevant for Malicious Execel files that are using Excel 4 Macros, since they tend to hide the Workbook with the Macro itself.

The PS1 script in the root folder is the latest version.
Additionally there's a separate folder for each version.
